  abstract = 	 {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layerâ€™s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.}

abstract="Validation can be used to detect when overfitting starts during supervised training of a neural network; training is then stopped before convergence to avoid the overfitting (``early stopping''). The exact criterion used for validation-based early stopping, however, is usually chosen in an ad-hoc fashion or training is stopped interactively. This trick describes how to select a stopping criterion in a systematic fashion; it is a trick for either speeding learning procedures or improving generalization, whichever is more important in the particular situation. An empirical investigation on multi-layer perceptrons shows that there exists a tradeoff between training time and generalization: From the given mix of 1296 training runs using different 12 problems and 24 different network architectures I conclude slower stopping criteria allow for small improvements in generalization (here: about 4{\%} on average), but cost much more training time (here: about factor 4 longer on average).",

	abstract="This article presents a new methodology to build, in real-time, compact local and global maps for outdoor navigation. The environment information is obtained from a 3D laser range. The navigation model, called Traversable Regions Model (TRM), is based on Voronoi diagram technique but adapted to large outdoor environments, that is, the model is built from 3D data. In the manuscript we also present a novel contribution to the regions modeling field in robotics. The method allows to calculate the roughness degree of an unknown terrain based on the normal vector deviation. The parameter which measure the roughness degree is called spherical variance and it will be useful to determine the traversable areas. The model built allows defining safe trajectories depending on the robot's capabilities and the terrain properties and will represent, in a topo-geometric way, the environment as local and global maps. The methodology presented is validated in real outdoor environments with an outdoor robot developed in our lab, called                                                                           {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}G{\}}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}O{\}}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}L{\}}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}I{\}}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}A{\}}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}T{\}}{\$}{\$}                .",

The pre-traversability is calculated using terrain roughness and roll and pitch change. The terrain roughness is based on the texture information from the image captured by the on-board camera. An artificial neural network has been trained to find the relationship between roll and pitch changes and image characters. In order to avoid the localization that the intransitable region could not be completely identified just using the image process method, the real-time traversability with slip element has been adopted to correct the error in pre-traversability. The fuzzy logic approach has been developed for the traversability integration. The experiment demonstrates that the navigation algorithm is effective.",

	abstract="Autonomous mobile robots need to adapt their behavior to the terrain over which they drive, and to predict the traversability of the terrain so that they can effectively plan their paths. Such robots usually make use of a set of sensors to investigate the terrain around them and build up an internal representation that enables them to navigate. This paper addresses the question of how to use sensor data to learn properties of the environment and use this knowledge to predict which regions of the environment are traversable. The approach makes use of sensed information from range sensors (stereo or ladar), color cameras, and the vehicle's navigation sensors. Models of terrain regions are learned from subsets of pixels that are selected by projection into a local occupancy grid. The models include color and texture as well as traversability information obtained from an analysis of the range data associated with the pixels. The models are learned without supervision, deriving their properties from the geometry and the appearance of the scene.",
